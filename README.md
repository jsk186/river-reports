# river-reports

A short jupyter notebook and associated pyhton script for conducting analysis of Potomac river data from the USGS Little Falls Branch river gage. The notebook pulls from the USGS website data such as river height, discharge, and temperature in two data sets: a wide data set for the past 11 years, and a narrower data set for the past 87 years. Also included in the repo is a manually-created sunrise-sunset lookup table using drawn from NOAA's Earth System Research Laboatory website.

The notebook walks through some basic analysis of the river's 2018 stats, compared to historical trends. I reported the results in the Word document, also in this repo.
